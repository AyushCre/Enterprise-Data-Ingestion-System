## 📖 Executive Summary
This project represents a scalable, secure, and high-performance **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Pipeline** designed for enterprise environments. It addresses three critical challenges in modern data engineering:
1.  **Security:** Preventing malicious file uploads (Malware/SQL Injection) before processing.
2.  **Performance:** Reducing processing latency by **6x-10x** using Parallel Architecture.
3.  **Flexibility:** Handling multiple formats (CSV & JSON) seamlessly with automated analytics.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🛡️ 1. Advanced Security Layer (The "Firewall")
Before any data enters the pipeline, it passes through a rigorous **Security Inspector** that performs:
* **Magic Byte Verification:** Detects executables (`.exe`) masking as CSV/JSON.
* **Heuristic Payload Analysis:** Scans for SQL Injection (`DROP TABLE`) and XSS attacks (`<script>`).
* **Double-Extension Detection:** Blocks spoofing attempts like `data.csv.exe`.

### ⚡ 2. High-Performance Computing (HPC)
* **Parallel Processing Engine:** Utilizes Python's `ProcessPoolExecutor` to utilize all CPU cores.
* **Benchmarking Tool:** Includes a live comparison mode showing **Sequential vs. Parallel** speedup metrics.

### 📊 3. Automated Analytics & Reporting
* **Dynamic Visualization:** Automatically generates financial insights (Revenue by Region) based on processed data.
* **KPI Dashboard:** Real-time metrics for Total Revenue, Transaction Volume, and Averages.
* **One-Click Export:** Processed artifacts are standardized to CSV and available for instant download.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Interface:** Streamlit (React-style declarative UI)
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas (Vectorized operations)
* **Concurrency:** Python Multiprocessing Module
* **I/O Operations:** Shutil & OS modules
